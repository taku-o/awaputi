# Requirements Document

## Introduction

ServiceWorkerでHEADリクエストがCache APIでサポートされていないため、HelpManagerがファイル存在確認に使用するHEADリクエストがキャッシュできずエラーが発生している問題を解決する。この問題により、ゲームの再アクセス時にコンソールエラーが表示され、ユーザー体験が損なわれている。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a game player, I want the game to work smoothly on subsequent visits without console errors, so that I can have a seamless gaming experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game is accessed for the second time THEN the ServiceWorker SHALL NOT produce cache-related errors for HEAD requests
2. WHEN HelpManager performs file existence checks THEN the requests SHALL be handled properly by the ServiceWorker
3. WHEN the game loads help content THEN no "Failed to execute 'put' on 'Cache'" errors SHALL appear in the console

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the ServiceWorker to handle all HTTP methods appropriately, so that the caching system works reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a HEAD request is intercepted by the ServiceWorker THEN it SHALL be processed without attempting to cache the request
2. WHEN a HEAD request is made THEN the ServiceWorker SHALL pass it through to the network without caching
3. IF a HEAD request fails THEN the ServiceWorker SHALL handle the error gracefully without breaking the cache system

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the HelpManager to work efficiently with the ServiceWorker, so that help content loading is optimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN HelpManager checks for file existence THEN it SHALL use a method compatible with ServiceWorker caching
2. WHEN help content is loaded THEN the content SHALL be cached appropriately for offline access
3. IF help content is not available THEN the system SHALL degrade gracefully without errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a game player, I want help content to be available offline, so that I can access game instructions even without internet connection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN help content is successfully loaded THEN it SHALL be cached for offline access
2. WHEN the game is offline THEN previously loaded help content SHALL be available
3. WHEN help content is requested offline AND not cached THEN a graceful fallback message SHALL be displayed
