# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a critical navigation bug where users cannot return to the main menu from the Help screen and Settings screen when pressing the ESC key. The issue occurs due to incorrect scene name references and improper scene navigation methods in both HelpScene and SettingsScene.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to be able to return to the main menu from the Settings screen by pressing ESC, so that I can navigate back without encountering errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user presses ESC in the Settings screen THEN the system SHALL navigate back to the main menu without errors
2. WHEN the Settings screen attempts to navigate back THEN the system SHALL use the correct scene name 'menu' instead of 'mainMenu'
3. WHEN the Settings screen navigation occurs THEN the system SHALL use the SceneManager.switchScene method properly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to be able to return to the main menu from the Help screen by pressing ESC, so that I can navigate back without encountering errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user presses ESC in the Help screen THEN the system SHALL navigate back to the main menu without errors
2. WHEN the Help screen attempts to navigate back THEN the system SHALL use the SceneManager.switchScene method instead of direct scene access
3. WHEN the Help screen navigation occurs THEN the system SHALL use the correct scene name 'menu'

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent scene navigation patterns across all scenes, so that navigation bugs are prevented and maintenance is simplified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any scene needs to navigate to another scene THEN the system SHALL use SceneManager.switchScene method consistently
2. WHEN scene names are referenced THEN the system SHALL use the correct registered scene names
3. WHEN navigation methods are implemented THEN the system SHALL follow the established scene management patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want reliable navigation throughout the game interface, so that I can move between screens without encountering JavaScript errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigation errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide proper error handling and fallback behavior
2. WHEN scene transitions happen THEN the system SHALL ensure proper cleanup of the previous scene
3. WHEN the main menu is accessed THEN the system SHALL ensure it is properly initialized and displayed
