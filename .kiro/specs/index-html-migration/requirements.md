# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to rebuild the main index.html file by migrating features from various working test files that were created during debugging. The current index.html has been simplified to a minimal working version, but many advanced features like audio functionality, enhanced game mechanics, and debugging tools need to be restored. The goal is to systematically extract and integrate these features while maintaining stability and following the project's ES6 module architecture.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Audio System Integration

**User Story:** As a player, I want to hear sound effects and background music while playing the bubble game, so that I have an immersive gaming experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game initializes THEN the AudioManager SHALL be properly loaded and initialized
2. WHEN a bubble is clicked THEN appropriate sound effects SHALL play
3. WHEN the game starts THEN background music SHALL begin playing
4. WHEN audio settings are changed THEN the audio system SHALL respond accordingly
5. IF audio initialization fails THEN the game SHALL continue to work without audio and display appropriate warnings

### Requirement 2: Enhanced Game Mechanics

**User Story:** As a player, I want improved bubble interactions and special effects, so that the gameplay is more engaging and visually appealing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN special bubbles (like pink bubbles) are clicked THEN healing effects SHALL be triggered
2. WHEN bubbles are dragged THEN particle effects SHALL be created
3. WHEN bubbles are popped THEN visual effects SHALL be displayed
4. WHEN the game runs THEN smooth animations SHALL be maintained
5. IF special effects fail THEN basic bubble functionality SHALL still work

### Requirement 3: Audio Visualization

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see visual effects that respond to the audio, so that the game feels more dynamic and connected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio is playing THEN visual effects SHALL synchronize with the audio
2. WHEN audio volume changes THEN visualization intensity SHALL adjust accordingly
3. WHEN no audio is playing THEN visualizations SHALL gracefully degrade
4. WHEN audio visualization is disabled THEN the game SHALL continue normally

### Requirement 4: Debugging and Development Tools

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integrated debugging tools and logging, so that I can monitor game performance and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN debug mode is enabled THEN comprehensive logging SHALL be available
2. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be captured and displayed appropriately
3. WHEN performance issues arise THEN monitoring tools SHALL provide insights
4. WHEN testing features THEN debug controls SHALL be accessible
5. IF debug tools fail THEN the main game SHALL continue to function

### Requirement 5: Configuration and Settings Management

**User Story:** As a player, I want to customize game settings and have them persist, so that my preferences are maintained across sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN settings are changed THEN they SHALL be saved to localStorage
2. WHEN the game loads THEN previous settings SHALL be restored
3. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN default settings SHALL be used
4. WHEN settings affect gameplay THEN changes SHALL be applied immediately

### Requirement 6: Stable Module Loading

**User Story:** As a user, I want the game to load reliably without errors, so that I can play consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN all ES6 modules SHALL be imported successfully
2. WHEN module loading fails THEN appropriate error messages SHALL be displayed
3. WHEN dependencies are missing THEN graceful fallbacks SHALL be provided
4. WHEN the game initializes THEN all core systems SHALL be ready

### Requirement 7: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to run smoothly on my device, so that I have a good gaming experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game runs THEN frame rate SHALL be maintained above 30 FPS
2. WHEN many bubbles are present THEN performance SHALL not degrade significantly
3. WHEN effects are active THEN memory usage SHALL be managed efficiently
4. WHEN performance issues occur THEN automatic optimization SHALL be applied

### Requirement 8: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want the game to handle errors gracefully, so that temporary issues don't break my gaming experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JavaScript errors occur THEN they SHALL be caught and logged
2. WHEN critical systems fail THEN fallback mechanisms SHALL activate
3. WHEN recovery is possible THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic recovery
4. WHEN errors are unrecoverable THEN clear user messages SHALL be displayed
