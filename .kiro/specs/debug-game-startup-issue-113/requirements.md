# Requirements Document

## Introduction

GitHub Issue #113で報告されたゲーム開始不可問題を段階的デバッグアプローチで修正する。複数のJavaScriptエラーとログの無限ループが発生しており、特にSafariブラウザでは実行ボタンが反応しない状態。ログからの原因追跡が困難なため、機能を段階的に無効化して最小構成から問題を特定し、修正する。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create a minimal game configuration to isolate the root cause of startup failures, so that I can systematically identify which components are causing the errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game is loaded with minimal configuration THEN the system SHALL start without JavaScript errors
2. WHEN components are disabled via feature flags THEN the system SHALL continue to function with remaining components
3. WHEN debugging mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logging for component initialization
4. IF a component fails to initialize THEN the system SHALL log the specific error and continue with other components

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to systematically enable components one by one, so that I can identify which specific component is causing the startup failure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a component is re-enabled THEN the system SHALL attempt to initialize it and log the result
2. WHEN an error occurs during component initialization THEN the system SHALL capture the exact error details and stack trace
3. WHEN all components are tested individually THEN the system SHALL provide a report of which components are working and which are failing
4. IF multiple components fail THEN the system SHALL prioritize fixing them based on their criticality to core game functionality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix the infinite logging loop issue, so that the game performance is not degraded and Safari browser becomes responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game is running THEN the system SHALL NOT produce repetitive log messages
2. WHEN audio state changes THEN the system SHALL log the change only once per actual state transition
3. WHEN performance optimizer runs THEN the system SHALL NOT trigger continuous logging cycles
4. WHEN seasonal effects update THEN the system SHALL log updates only when themes actually change

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix the specific JavaScript errors identified in the issue, so that the game can start successfully in all browsers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing targetFPS property THEN the system SHALL ensure the configuration object is properly initialized
2. WHEN accessing title property THEN the system SHALL verify the object exists before property access
3. WHEN setting quality level THEN the system SHALL validate the value is not null before assignment
4. WHEN calling load method THEN the system SHALL ensure the target object is not null
5. WHEN initializing socialSharingManager THEN the system SHALL verify the method exists before calling

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement proper error handling and graceful degradation, so that individual component failures don't prevent the entire game from starting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a non-critical component fails THEN the system SHALL continue initialization with other components
2. WHEN a critical component fails THEN the system SHALL provide a meaningful error message and fallback behavior
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL use the centralized ErrorHandler utility for consistent error management
4. WHEN the game starts with some components disabled THEN the system SHALL inform the user about reduced functionality

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create a systematic testing approach, so that I can verify each fix works correctly before moving to the next component.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a component is fixed THEN the system SHALL provide automated tests to verify the fix
2. WHEN running in different browsers THEN the system SHALL behave consistently across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
3. WHEN testing component interactions THEN the system SHALL verify that fixed components work together properly
4. WHEN all fixes are complete THEN the system SHALL pass all existing tests without regression
