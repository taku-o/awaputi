# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the issue of duplicate help and settings screens in the BubblePop game. Currently, there are two different implementations for both help and settings functionality:

1. **Help Screens**: One accessible via main menu navigation and another via H key shortcut
2. **Settings Screens**: One accessible via main menu navigation and another via ESC key from help screen

This duplication leads to inconsistent user experience, potential feature gaps between implementations, and maintenance overhead. The goal is to consolidate these duplicate implementations into single, unified screens while preserving all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want a single, consistent help screen regardless of how I access it, so that I have the same features and experience every time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access help via the main menu THEN I SHALL see the same help screen as when accessing via H key shortcut
2. WHEN I navigate to help via any method THEN the system SHALL use the same HelpScene implementation
3. WHEN I use help features THEN all functionality SHALL be available regardless of access method
4. WHEN I exit the help screen THEN the system SHALL return me to the appropriate previous screen

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want a single, consistent settings screen regardless of how I access it, so that I have the same configuration options available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access settings via the main menu THEN I SHALL see the same settings screen as when accessing via other methods
2. WHEN I navigate to settings via any method THEN the system SHALL use the same SettingsScene implementation
3. WHEN I configure settings THEN all options SHALL be available regardless of access method
4. WHEN I exit the settings screen THEN the system SHALL return me to the appropriate previous screen

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate duplicate screen implementations, so that maintenance is simplified and feature parity is ensured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the consolidation is complete THEN there SHALL be only one HelpScene implementation
2. WHEN the consolidation is complete THEN there SHALL be only one SettingsScene implementation
3. WHEN duplicate code is removed THEN all existing functionality SHALL be preserved
4. WHEN new features are added THEN they SHALL only need to be implemented once per screen type

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want keyboard shortcuts to work consistently, so that I can quickly access help and settings without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I press the H key THEN the system SHALL open the unified help screen
2. WHEN I press ESC in the help screen THEN the system SHALL return to the previous screen appropriately
3. WHEN I access settings via keyboard shortcuts THEN the system SHALL open the unified settings screen
4. WHEN keyboard shortcuts are used THEN the navigation behavior SHALL be consistent with menu-based access

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify and preserve unique features from each implementation, so that no functionality is lost during consolidation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing existing implementations THEN the system SHALL catalog all unique features in each version
2. WHEN consolidating screens THEN all unique features SHALL be integrated into the unified implementation
3. WHEN features conflict between implementations THEN the system SHALL use the more complete or recent implementation
4. WHEN consolidation is complete THEN feature parity SHALL be verified through testing

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want proper navigation context preservation, so that I return to the correct screen when exiting help or settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access help from the main menu THEN ESC SHALL return me to the main menu
2. WHEN I access help via H key shortcut THEN ESC SHALL return me to the previous screen
3. WHEN I access settings from the main menu THEN ESC SHALL return me to the main menu
4. WHEN navigation context changes THEN the system SHALL track and restore the appropriate previous screen

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to investigate other potential duplicate screens, so that the entire application has consistent screen implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN investigating the codebase THEN the system SHALL identify any other duplicate screen implementations
2. WHEN duplicate screens are found THEN they SHALL be documented for future consolidation
3. WHEN the investigation is complete THEN a report SHALL be generated listing all findings
4. WHEN patterns are identified THEN recommendations SHALL be made to prevent future duplication
