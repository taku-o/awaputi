# Requirements Document

## Introduction

視覚効果システムの強化により、ゲームの視覚的魅力とユーザー体験を向上させる機能を実装します。現在基本的なパーティクルエフェクトと画面効果は実装されていますが、より多様で魅力的な視覚効果の実装が求められています。この機能により、泡の種類別破壊エフェクト、コンボエフェクトの多様化、特殊効果の強化、背景パーティクル、季節限定エフェクト、画面効果の強化、アニメーション改善、エフェクト品質制御を実現します。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see diverse and attractive particle effects when bubbles are destroyed, so that the game feels more engaging and visually appealing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a bubble is destroyed THEN the system SHALL display a particle effect specific to the bubble type
2. WHEN a normal bubble is destroyed THEN the system SHALL create 15+ particles with appropriate colors and physics
3. WHEN a special bubble (rainbow, electric, spiky, diamond, etc.) is destroyed THEN the system SHALL create unique particle effects with distinct visual characteristics
4. WHEN multiple bubbles are destroyed simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle particle generation without performance degradation
5. WHEN particle quality is set to low THEN the system SHALL reduce particle count while maintaining visual impact

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see enhanced combo effects that become more spectacular as my combo increases, so that I feel rewarded for skillful play.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a combo of 2-5 is achieved THEN the system SHALL display basic combo particles with golden colors
2. WHEN a combo of 6-10 is achieved THEN the system SHALL display enhanced combo effects with larger particles and screen flash
3. WHEN a combo of 11+ is achieved THEN the system SHALL display spectacular combo effects with screen shake, zoom, and rainbow particles
4. WHEN a combo is broken THEN the system SHALL display a subtle fade-out effect
5. WHEN combo effects are disabled in settings THEN the system SHALL show minimal combo feedback

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see improved screen effects that enhance the game atmosphere, so that the game feels more immersive and polished.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN screen transitions occur THEN the system SHALL display smooth fade/slide animations
2. WHEN special events happen THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate screen effects (flash, shake, zoom, tint)
3. WHEN background effects are enabled THEN the system SHALL display subtle environmental particles
4. WHEN lighting effects are enabled THEN the system SHALL render dynamic light sources and shadows
5. WHEN reflection effects are enabled THEN the system SHALL display appropriate reflection effects on bubbles

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see enhanced UI animations that make the interface feel responsive and modern, so that the game experience feels polished.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN bubbles are generated THEN the system SHALL display smooth spawn animations
2. WHEN UI elements appear THEN the system SHALL use appropriate entrance animations (fade, slide, bounce)
3. WHEN score changes THEN the system SHALL display animated score updates with scaling effects
4. WHEN menu transitions occur THEN the system SHALL use smooth transition animations
5. WHEN loading occurs THEN the system SHALL display engaging loading animations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want to have control over effect quality settings, so that I can optimize performance based on my device capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN effect quality is set to "High" THEN the system SHALL display all effects at maximum quality
2. WHEN effect quality is set to "Medium" THEN the system SHALL reduce particle count by 50% while maintaining visual impact
3. WHEN effect quality is set to "Low" THEN the system SHALL reduce particle count by 75% and disable complex effects
4. WHEN effects are disabled THEN the system SHALL show minimal visual feedback only
5. WHEN performance drops below 30 FPS THEN the system SHALL automatically reduce effect quality

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see seasonal and special event effects, so that the game feels fresh and celebrates different occasions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN seasonal mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL display season-appropriate background particles
2. WHEN special events are active THEN the system SHALL modify particle colors and effects to match the theme
3. WHEN holiday themes are enabled THEN the system SHALL add themed particle effects and animations
4. WHEN custom themes are selected THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate visual modifications
5. WHEN seasonal effects are disabled THEN the system SHALL revert to standard effects

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the effect system to maintain good performance on mobile devices, so that the game runs smoothly across different platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust effect quality based on device capabilities
2. WHEN particle count exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL use object pooling to manage memory efficiently
3. WHEN frame rate drops THEN the system SHALL dynamically reduce effect complexity
4. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL clean up unused effect resources
5. WHEN effects are rendered THEN the system SHALL use optimized rendering techniques to minimize draw calls

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a player, I want the new effects to integrate seamlessly with existing game systems, so that the enhanced visuals don't disrupt gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new effects are active THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing EffectManager and ParticleManager
2. WHEN configuration changes occur THEN the system SHALL update effect settings without requiring restart
3. WHEN effects are triggered THEN the system SHALL coordinate with audio system for synchronized audio-visual feedback
4. WHEN accessibility features are enabled THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate alternatives for visual effects
5. WHEN debug mode is active THEN the system SHALL provide detailed effect performance metrics
