4. WHEN analyzing help effectiveness THEN the public API SHALL remain unchanged
5. WHEN generating reports THEN analysis cache and report cache systems SHALL function properly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MotionManager.js file (2,754 words) to be split using Main Controller Pattern, so that motion management is organized by motion categories and accessibility features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN splitting MotionManager.js THEN the main controller SHALL be under 2,500 words
2. WHEN creating sub-components THEN they SHALL handle motion configuration, animation control, vestibular safety, and system preference detection separately
3. WHEN the split is complete THEN all motion management functionality SHALL work correctly
4. WHEN managing animations THEN the public API SHALL remain unchanged
5. WHEN vestibular safety features are used THEN motion reduction and safety guidelines SHALL be properly enforced

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the ChallengeUI.js file (2,644 words) to be split using Main Controller Pattern, so that challenge UI functionality is organized by UI components and interaction handling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN splitting ChallengeUI.js THEN the main controller SHALL be under 2,500 words
2. WHEN creating sub-components THEN they SHALL handle UI rendering, user interaction, challenge data management, and progress tracking separately
3. WHEN the split is complete THEN all challenge UI functionality SHALL work correctly
4. WHEN using challenge UI THEN the public API SHALL remain unchanged
5. WHEN challenge interactions occur THEN UI responsiveness and data consistency SHALL be maintained

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the TimingAdjustmentManager.js file (2,535 words) to be split using Main Controller Pattern, so that timing adjustment functionality is organized by adjustment types and calibration operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN splitting TimingAdjustmentManager.js THEN the main controller SHALL be under 2,500 words
2. WHEN creating sub-components THEN they SHALL handle timing calibration, adjustment algorithms, performance monitoring, and user feedback separately
3. WHEN the split is complete THEN all timing adjustment functionality SHALL work correctly
4. WHEN adjusting timing THEN the public API SHALL remain unchanged
5. WHEN calibration operations are performed THEN timing accuracy and performance SHALL be maintained

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the file splitting to follow the established Main Controller Pattern and component design standards, so that the codebase maintains consistency and quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN splitting files THEN the process SHALL follow Main Controller Pattern guidelines established in previous phases

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and fallback mechanisms in the split components, so that the application remains stable even if individual components fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a sub-component fails THEN the main controller SHALL handle the error gracefully

2. WHEN existing APIs are called THEN they SHALL behave identically to the pre-split implementation
3. WHEN event systems are used THEN they SHALL continue to work with the split components
4. WHEN configuration systems interact with split components THEN they SHALL function without modification
5. WHEN the split is complete THEN no other files in the codebase SHALL require changes
