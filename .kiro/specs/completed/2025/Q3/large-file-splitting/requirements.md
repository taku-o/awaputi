# Requirements Document

## Introduction

GitHub Issue #72に対応し、MCPトークン制限（2,500語）を超過する大容量ファイルを分割することで、MCPツールの安定動作を維持し、プロジェクトの保守性を向上させる。主要対象は`PerformanceOptimizer.js`（5,092語）と`ComparisonEngine.js`（5,043語）である。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all JavaScript files to be under 2,500 words, so that MCP tools can function properly without token limit issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing file sizes THEN all JavaScript files SHALL be 2,500 words or less
2. WHEN using MCP tools (find_symbol) THEN they SHALL operate without token limit errors
3. WHEN checking the project health THEN no files SHALL exceed the 2,500 word limit

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the PerformanceOptimizer.js file to be split into manageable components, so that each component has a single responsibility and is maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN splitting PerformanceOptimizer.js THEN the main file SHALL be under 2,500 words
2. WHEN creating sub-components THEN each SHALL have a single, clear responsibility
3. WHEN the split is complete THEN all existing functionality SHALL remain intact
4. WHEN importing the main class THEN the API SHALL remain unchanged for backward compatibility

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the ComparisonEngine.js file to be split into manageable components, so that statistical analysis functions are organized by their specific purpose.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN splitting ComparisonEngine.js THEN the main file SHALL be under 2,500 words
2. WHEN creating sub-components THEN statistical functions SHALL be grouped by their analytical purpose
3. WHEN the split is complete THEN all comparison and analysis functionality SHALL work correctly
4. WHEN using the comparison engine THEN the public API SHALL remain unchanged

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the file splitting to follow the established component design standards, so that the codebase maintains consistency and quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN splitting files THEN the process SHALL follow docs/component-design-standards.md guidelines
2. WHEN creating new components THEN they SHALL use proper ES6 module import/export patterns
3. WHEN organizing files THEN they SHALL be placed in appropriate directory structures
4. WHEN naming components THEN they SHALL follow the established naming conventions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing to ensure the split components work correctly, so that no functionality is broken during the refactoring process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the splitting is complete THEN all existing tests SHALL pass
2. WHEN running the build process THEN it SHALL complete successfully
3. WHEN testing the application THEN all features SHALL function as before
4. WHEN using the split components THEN performance SHALL not be degraded

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and fallback mechanisms in the split components, so that the application remains stable even if individual components fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a sub-component fails THEN the main component SHALL handle the error gracefully
2. WHEN dependencies are missing THEN appropriate fallback behavior SHALL be provided
3. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient context for debugging
4. WHEN the system recovers from errors THEN normal operation SHALL resume automatically
