# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the test suite repair issue identified in GitHub Issue #106, where 15 out of 114 test files are failing (13% failure rate, 87% success rate). The failures stem from multiple structural problems following the Phase G file splitting project completion, including module path inconsistencies, API method mismatches, missing dependencies, and Jest environment issues. The goal is to restore test suite stability to 95%+ success rate and ensure quality assurance for the post-Phase G codebase.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Module Path Inconsistency Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all module import paths to be correct so that tests can find and load required dependencies without path resolution errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests import ErrorHandler THEN the system SHALL resolve the correct path to `src/utils/ErrorHandler.js`
2. WHEN tests import PerformanceOptimizer THEN the system SHALL resolve the correct path to `src/utils/PerformanceOptimizer.js`
3. WHEN tests import MockFactory THEN the system SHALL resolve the correct path from `tests/mocks/MockFactory.js`
4. WHEN file splitting results in moved modules THEN all import paths SHALL be updated accordingly
5. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL NOT display "Cannot find module" errors for existing files

### Requirement 2: API Method Consistency Restoration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test expectations to match actual API implementations so that tests validate the correct functionality after Phase G refactoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests call enhancedParticleManager.enableBatchRendering() THEN the method SHALL exist in the EnhancedParticleManager implementation
2. WHEN tests expect specific API methods THEN those methods SHALL be implemented in the corresponding classes
3. WHEN API interfaces change during refactoring THEN tests SHALL be updated to match the new interfaces
4. WHEN EffectPerformanceOptimizer calls particle manager methods THEN those methods SHALL exist and function correctly
5. WHEN tests validate object properties THEN those properties SHALL exist in the actual implementations

### Requirement 3: Missing Dependencies Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all required test dependencies to be available so that tests can execute without missing package errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests require fake-indexeddb THEN the package SHALL be installed or a suitable mock SHALL be provided
2. WHEN tests require inquirer THEN the package SHALL be installed or the dependency SHALL be removed if unnecessary
3. WHEN package.json is updated THEN all test dependencies SHALL be properly declared
4. WHEN tests run in CI environment THEN all dependencies SHALL be available and properly installed
5. WHEN new dependencies are added THEN they SHALL be documented and justified

### Requirement 4: Jest Environment Stability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Jest environment to be stable and properly isolated so that tests don't interfere with each other or fail due to environment teardown issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Jest environment is torn down THEN no imports SHALL be attempted after teardown
2. WHEN tests run in sequence THEN each test SHALL have proper isolation and cleanup
3. WHEN ES Modules are used with Jest THEN the environment SHALL handle module loading correctly
4. WHEN async operations are performed in tests THEN proper cleanup SHALL prevent environment conflicts
5. WHEN tests complete THEN all resources SHALL be properly released to prevent memory leaks

### Requirement 5: Post-Phase G Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the test suite to be compatible with the Phase G file splitting architecture so that the new modular structure is properly tested.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Phase G split files are tested THEN all new file paths SHALL be correctly referenced
2. WHEN component architecture is tested THEN the new component structure SHALL be validated
3. WHEN split modules interact THEN the interactions SHALL be properly tested
4. WHEN new interfaces are created THEN corresponding tests SHALL validate the interfaces
5. WHEN legacy code is refactored THEN tests SHALL be updated to match the new structure

### Requirement 6: Test Suite Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the test suite to achieve 95%+ success rate consistently so that CI/CD pipelines are reliable and development productivity is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all fixes are implemented THEN test success rate SHALL be at least 95%
2. WHEN tests are run multiple times THEN results SHALL be consistent across runs
3. WHEN CI/CD pipeline executes tests THEN they SHALL complete without infrastructure-related failures
4. WHEN test failures occur THEN they SHALL indicate actual code issues, not configuration problems
5. WHEN new tests are added THEN they SHALL follow established patterns and maintain stability

### Requirement 7: Development Workflow Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test fixes to integrate seamlessly with existing development workflows so that productivity improvements from Phase G are maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are fixed THEN existing npm scripts SHALL continue to function correctly
2. WHEN test configuration is updated THEN it SHALL maintain backward compatibility
3. WHEN import paths are corrected THEN the changes SHALL not break existing functionality
4. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN the development environment setup SHALL remain straightforward
5. WHEN test execution time is optimized THEN overall development cycle time SHALL improve

### Requirement 8: Quality Assurance Enhancement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the test suite to provide reliable quality assurance for the Phase G architecture so that code quality is maintained at a high standard.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code changes are made THEN tests SHALL accurately validate the changes
2. WHEN regressions are introduced THEN tests SHALL detect them reliably
3. WHEN new features are added THEN test coverage SHALL be maintained or improved
4. WHEN refactoring is performed THEN tests SHALL validate that functionality is preserved
5. WHEN performance optimizations are made THEN tests SHALL verify that performance targets are met
