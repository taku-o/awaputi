# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical functionality issues in the help system of the BubblePop game. The help system currently has several broken features including non-functional search, missing methods causing errors, and keyboard shortcuts not working properly. This fix will restore full functionality to the help system to provide users with proper assistance and documentation access.

## Requirements

**User Story:** As a player, I want to access the help system using keyboard shortcuts (H key), so that I can quickly get assistance while playing the game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user presses the H key THEN the system SHALL switch to the help scene
2. WHEN the help scene is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the help interface with categories and content
3. WHEN the user presses ESC in the help scene THEN the system SHALL return to the previous scene
4. IF the help system fails to load THEN the system SHALL display an error message and provide fallback options

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to search for specific help topics, so that I can quickly find information relevant to my current needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the help scene is displayed THEN the system SHALL show a functional search bar
2. WHEN the user clicks on the search bar THEN the system SHALL focus the search input
3. WHEN the user types in the search bar THEN the system SHALL display search results in real-time
4. WHEN the search query is empty THEN the system SHALL return to the normal category view
5. WHEN the user presses the "/" key THEN the system SHALL focus the search bar
6. IF no search results are found THEN the system SHALL display a "no results found" message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want to navigate through help categories and topics without encountering errors, so that I can access all available help content smoothly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a help category THEN the system SHALL display the category content without errors
2. WHEN the user selects a help topic THEN the system SHALL display the topic content without errors
3. WHEN the user navigates between categories THEN the system SHALL not generate console errors
4. WHEN the user exits a topic THEN the system SHALL properly track the exit without throwing errors
5. IF analytics tracking fails THEN the system SHALL continue to function normally without breaking the user experience

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the help system analytics to work properly, so that I can track user behavior and improve the help content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a category THEN the system SHALL record the category selection using `recordCategorySelection` method
2. WHEN a user exits a topic THEN the system SHALL record the topic exit using `recordTopicExit` method
3. WHEN analytics methods are called THEN the system SHALL not throw "function not defined" errors
4. WHEN analytics data is collected THEN the system SHALL store it properly for later analysis
5. IF analytics systems fail THEN the system SHALL log the error but continue normal operation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want the help content to display properly with all visual elements, so that I can easily read and understand the help information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the help scene loads THEN the system SHALL display the search bar, sidebar, and content area correctly
2. WHEN content is displayed THEN the system SHALL use proper fonts, colors, and layout
3. WHEN the user interacts with help elements THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback (hover, focus states)
4. WHEN accessibility features are enabled THEN the system SHALL announce navigation changes to screen readers
5. IF rendering fails THEN the system SHALL display a fallback text-based help interface

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want contextual help that adapts to my current game state, so that I can get relevant assistance based on what I'm doing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the help system is accessed from different game scenes THEN the system SHALL show contextually relevant help content
2. WHEN contextual help is displayed THEN the system SHALL highlight the most relevant topics for the current context
3. WHEN the user returns from contextual help THEN the system SHALL navigate back to the appropriate scene
4. IF contextual analysis fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to standard help mode
5. WHEN contextual help is active THEN the system SHALL indicate this to the user through visual cues
