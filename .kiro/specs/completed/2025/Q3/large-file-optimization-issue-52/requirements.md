# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the optimization of large files in the Bubble Pop Web Game project, specifically targeting files that exceed Claude Code's token limit (25,000 tokens). The primary focus is on UserInfoScene.js (3,734 lines, 133KB) and other large files that impact development efficiency when using AI-assisted development tools.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to be able to read and modify large files using AI tools without token limitations, so that I can maintain code efficiently without manual file splitting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer attempts to read UserInfoScene.js with AI tools THEN the system SHALL provide access to the complete file content without token limit errors
2. WHEN using AI-assisted development tools THEN the system SHALL support full file analysis and modification capabilities
3. IF a file exceeds 25,000 tokens THEN the system SHALL provide alternative access methods that maintain development workflow efficiency

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want large files to be modularly organized, so that I can understand and maintain specific functionality without navigating through thousands of lines of code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining UserInfoScene.js THEN the system SHALL separate distinct functional areas into logical components
2. WHEN working on statistics functionality THEN the developer SHALL be able to access statistics-related code in a dedicated module
3. WHEN working on achievements functionality THEN the developer SHALL be able to access achievements-related code in a dedicated module
4. WHEN working on user management functionality THEN the developer SHALL be able to access user management-related code in a dedicated module
5. WHEN working on help functionality THEN the developer SHALL be able to access help-related code in a dedicated module

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the refactored code to maintain existing functionality, so that the game continues to work exactly as before without any behavioral changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN all existing game functionality SHALL work identically to the current implementation
2. WHEN users interact with the UserInfo scene THEN all tabs (statistics, achievements, management, help) SHALL function exactly as they currently do
3. WHEN the game loads THEN the UserInfoScene SHALL initialize and render without any visual or functional differences
4. IF any existing tests exist THEN they SHALL continue to pass after refactoring

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the refactored architecture to follow the project's established patterns, so that the code remains consistent with the existing codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating new component files THEN they SHALL follow the existing ES6 module system with .js extensions
2. WHEN organizing new files THEN they SHALL be placed in appropriate directories following the established src/ structure
3. WHEN implementing new classes THEN they SHALL use ES6 class syntax consistent with existing code
4. WHEN adding imports/exports THEN they SHALL use named exports and include .js extensions as per project conventions
5. WHEN writing comments and documentation THEN they SHALL use Japanese for comments as per project standards

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the optimization to be implemented incrementally, so that I can validate each step and minimize risk of introducing bugs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the optimization THEN the system SHALL support a phased approach starting with the largest, most self-contained components
2. WHEN each component is extracted THEN it SHALL be tested independently before proceeding to the next component
3. WHEN the main UserInfoScene class is modified THEN it SHALL maintain its public interface to ensure compatibility
4. IF any issues are discovered during implementation THEN the developer SHALL be able to rollback individual components without affecting the entire refactoring

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to apply similar optimization patterns to other large files, so that the entire codebase benefits from improved maintainability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the UserInfoScene optimization is complete THEN the same patterns SHALL be applicable to MobilePerformanceOptimizer.js (3,378 lines)
2. WHEN the optimization patterns are established THEN they SHALL be applicable to StatisticsManager.js (2,259 lines)
3. WHEN the optimization patterns are established THEN they SHALL be applicable to AchievementManager.js (2,230 lines)
4. WHEN creating optimization guidelines THEN they SHALL be documented for future use on other large files
