# Requirements Document

## Introduction

BubblePopゲームをより使いやすくするため、Progressive Web App (PWA) 機能を実装します。現在、プロジェクトには既にmanifest.json、Service Worker (sw.js)、PWAManagerが存在していますが、Issue #33で要求されている機能の完全な実装と、不足している要素（アイコンファイル、メタタグの最適化など）を追加する必要があります。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to install the game as a PWA on my device, so that I can access it like a native app from my home screen.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user visits the game on a compatible browser THEN the system SHALL display an install prompt
2. WHEN the user accepts the install prompt THEN the app SHALL be installed on their device
3. WHEN the app is installed THEN it SHALL appear on the home screen with proper icon and name
4. WHEN the user launches the installed app THEN it SHALL open in standalone mode without browser UI

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the game to work offline, so that I can continue playing even without internet connection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user has visited the game at least once THEN the system SHALL cache essential game files
2. WHEN the user goes offline THEN the game SHALL continue to function with cached resources
3. WHEN the user is offline THEN the system SHALL display appropriate offline indicators
4. WHEN the user comes back online THEN the system SHALL sync any pending data automatically

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper PWA icons and metadata, so that the app displays correctly across different devices and platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the PWA is installed THEN it SHALL display proper icons for all required sizes (192x192px, 512x512px)
2. WHEN the app is viewed on iOS devices THEN it SHALL use Apple Touch Icons (180x180px)
3. WHEN the app is displayed in browser tabs THEN it SHALL show proper favicons (32x32px, 16x16px)
4. WHEN the app is installed THEN it SHALL use maskable icons for adaptive icon support

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the app to behave like a native app, so that I have a seamless mobile experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is launched on mobile THEN it SHALL hide the browser address bar and navigation
2. WHEN the app is running THEN it SHALL use the configured theme color for system UI
3. WHEN the app is in standalone mode THEN it SHALL prevent pull-to-refresh gestures
4. WHEN the app is launched THEN it SHALL use the proper display mode (standalone)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Service Worker to manage caching efficiently, so that the app loads quickly and uses storage responsibly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are cached THEN the system SHALL implement cache-first strategy for static assets
2. WHEN dynamic content is requested THEN the system SHALL implement network-first strategy
3. WHEN cache storage exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL automatically clean up old entries
4. WHEN the app is updated THEN the system SHALL update cached files and notify users

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper PWA metadata and configuration, so that the app integrates well with the operating system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the manifest is loaded THEN it SHALL contain all required PWA metadata fields
2. WHEN the app is installed THEN it SHALL support app shortcuts for quick actions
3. WHEN the app handles files THEN it SHALL register appropriate file handlers
4. WHEN the app is shared THEN it SHALL support Web Share Target API

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want missing PWA assets to be created, so that the PWA functions properly across all platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the PWA is accessed THEN all referenced icon files SHALL exist and be accessible
2. WHEN the app is installed on different devices THEN appropriate icon sizes SHALL be available
3. WHEN the app is viewed in different contexts THEN proper favicon files SHALL be served
4. WHEN the app uses Apple-specific features THEN Apple Touch Icons SHALL be properly configured
