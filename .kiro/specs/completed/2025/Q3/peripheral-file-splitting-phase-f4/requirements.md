# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for Phase F.4 of the large file splitting project, focusing on peripheral files and tools. The goal is to split 5-7 large files (over 2,500 words) into smaller, more manageable components while maintaining full functionality and improving maintainability. This phase specifically targets tools, audio accessibility, SEO testing, dashboard functionality, and UI components that support the main game functionality.

2. WHEN the splitting is complete THEN the tools/balance-adjuster.js (3,168 words) SHALL be split into multiple focused tool components
3. WHEN the splitting is complete THEN the src/audio/AudioAccessibilitySupport.js (2,582 words) SHALL be split into accessibility modules
4. WHEN the splitting is complete THEN the src/seo/SEOTester.js (2,576 words) SHALL be split into testing components

7. WHEN the splitting is complete THEN the scripts/performance-impact-assessment.js (2,543 words) SHALL be split into assessment modules
8. WHEN the splitting is complete THEN the src/scenes/components/ImportDialog.js (2,536 words) SHALL be split into dialog components

### Requirement 2: Tool Functionality Preservation

**User Story:** As a developer using development tools, I want all tool functionality to remain intact after file splitting, so that my development workflow continues uninterrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN balance-adjuster.js is split THEN all interactive balance adjustment features SHALL continue to work
2. WHEN dashboard.js is split THEN all configuration monitoring and visualization features SHALL remain functional
3. WHEN performance-impact-assessment.js is split THEN all assessment and reporting capabilities SHALL be preserved
4. WHEN tool commands are executed THEN they SHALL produce identical results to before the split
5. WHEN tool interfaces are used THEN they SHALL maintain the same user experience
6. WHEN tool configurations are accessed THEN they SHALL work exactly as before

### Requirement 3: Audio System Integrity

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want all audio accessibility and caching functionality to work perfectly after file splitting, so that my gaming experience remains optimal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AudioAccessibilitySupport is split THEN all visual notifications SHALL continue to function
2. WHEN audio caching is used THEN all LRU cache functionality SHALL be preserved
3. WHEN accessibility features are enabled THEN vibration, captions, and color indicators SHALL work identically
4. WHEN audio cache management runs THEN memory optimization and cleanup SHALL function as before
5. WHEN audio accessibility settings are changed THEN all configuration options SHALL remain available
6. WHEN real-time audio processing occurs THEN performance SHALL not be degraded

### Requirement 4: SEO and UI Component Functionality

**User Story:** As a web developer maintaining SEO and UI components, I want all testing and dialog functionality to remain intact after splitting, so that website optimization and user interfaces continue to work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SEOTester is split THEN all meta tag validation SHALL continue to work
2. WHEN SEO testing runs THEN structured data validation and performance checks SHALL function identically
3. WHEN ImportDialog is split THEN all data import functionality SHALL be preserved
4. WHEN dialog interactions occur THEN user experience SHALL remain unchanged
5. WHEN SEO reports are generated THEN they SHALL contain the same information as before
6. WHEN import processes are executed THEN they SHALL handle all supported data formats

### Requirement 5: Architecture Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want the split files to follow consistent architectural patterns, so that the code remains easy to understand and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are split THEN each component SHALL follow the Main Controller Pattern established in previous phases
2. WHEN creating new modules THEN they SHALL use ES6 module syntax with .js extensions
3. WHEN splitting classes THEN the main class SHALL act as a controller coordinating sub-components
4. WHEN creating sub-components THEN they SHALL have clear, single responsibilities
5. WHEN organizing files THEN they SHALL be grouped in logical directory structures
6. WHEN implementing imports THEN all imports SHALL include .js extensions

### Requirement 6: Balance Adjuster Tool Split

**User Story:** As a game balance designer, I want the balance adjustment tool to be split into focused components, so that I can work on specific aspects of balance management independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN balance-adjuster.js is split THEN it SHALL be divided into BalanceDataLoader, BalanceCalculator, BalanceValidator, and BalanceExporter components
2. WHEN balance data is loaded THEN BalanceDataLoader SHALL handle all configuration reading and parsing
3. WHEN balance calculations are performed THEN BalanceCalculator SHALL handle all mathematical operations and impact analysis
4. WHEN balance validation occurs THEN BalanceValidator SHALL handle all validation rules and constraint checking
5. WHEN balance results are exported THEN BalanceExporter SHALL handle all output formatting and file generation
6. WHEN the main tool runs THEN it SHALL coordinate all sub-components seamlessly

### Requirement 7: Audio Accessibility Support Split

**User Story:** As an accessibility engineer, I want the AudioAccessibilitySupport to be split into specialized components, so that I can focus on specific aspects of audio accessibility independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AudioAccessibilitySupport is split THEN it SHALL be divided into AudioDescriptionManager, AudioCueManager, AudioFeedbackManager, and AudioSettingsManager components
2. WHEN audio descriptions are needed THEN AudioDescriptionManager SHALL handle all descriptive audio functionality
3. WHEN audio cues are played THEN AudioCueManager SHALL handle all audio cue generation and management
4. WHEN audio feedback is provided THEN AudioFeedbackManager SHALL handle all user feedback mechanisms
5. WHEN accessibility settings are managed THEN AudioSettingsManager SHALL handle all configuration and preferences
6. WHEN the main support system runs THEN it SHALL coordinate all accessibility sub-components

### Requirement 8: Test Coverage Maintenance

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want all existing tests to continue passing after file splitting, so that I can be confident the refactoring didn't break functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN file splitting is complete THEN all existing unit tests SHALL pass without modification
2. WHEN integration tests run THEN they SHALL pass with the new file structure
3. WHEN tool tests execute THEN they SHALL verify all tool functionality works correctly
4. WHEN accessibility tests run THEN they SHALL confirm all accessibility features function properly
5. WHEN SEO tests are executed THEN they SHALL validate all SEO testing capabilities
6. WHEN UI component tests run THEN they SHALL verify all dialog and interface functionality

### Requirement 9: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer using these utilities in other parts of the codebase, I want the public interfaces to remain unchanged, so that I don't need to update my existing code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN public methods are called THEN they SHALL behave identically to before the split
3. WHEN tool commands are executed THEN they SHALL maintain the same command-line interface

5. WHEN events are emitted THEN they SHALL maintain the same event signatures
6. WHEN APIs are called THEN they SHALL return the same data structures and formats
