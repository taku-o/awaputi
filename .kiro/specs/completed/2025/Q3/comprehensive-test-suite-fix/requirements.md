# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the comprehensive test suite failure issue affecting 676 out of 1338 tests (approximately 50% failure rate) in the BubblePop web game project. The failures stem from multiple categories including Jest configuration issues, mock function problems, API method inconsistencies, performance test instability, and E2E test execution problems. The goal is to restore test suite reliability to ensure CI/CD stability, improve development efficiency, and maintain code quality assurance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Jest Configuration and ES Modules Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Jest to properly work with ES Modules so that I can run unit tests without configuration errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm test` THEN the system SHALL NOT display "jest is not defined" errors
2. WHEN using ES6 import/export syntax in tests THEN Jest SHALL properly resolve module dependencies
3. WHEN tests use jest.fn() THEN the system SHALL recognize Jest mock functions without errors
4. IF setupFilesAfterEnv is configured THEN Jest SHALL properly load setup files for ES Modules
5. WHEN running tests in both browser and console environments THEN Jest SHALL work consistently in both contexts

### Requirement 2: Mock Function Standardization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent mock functions across all test files so that tests are reliable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests require mock functions THEN the system SHALL use jest.fn() consistently
2. WHEN Canvas API is needed in tests THEN the system SHALL provide proper Canvas mocks
3. WHEN AudioManager is mocked THEN the system SHALL provide all expected methods and properties
4. WHEN localStorage is mocked THEN the system SHALL provide complete localStorage API compatibility
5. WHEN performance API is mocked THEN the system SHALL provide realistic performance metrics

### Requirement 3: API Method Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test expectations to match actual API implementations so that tests accurately validate functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests call audioManager.getStatus() THEN the method SHALL exist in the actual implementation
2. WHEN tests call analyticsAPI.evaluateCondition() THEN the method SHALL exist in the actual implementation
3. WHEN tests expect specific properties on objects THEN those properties SHALL exist in the actual classes
4. WHEN API interfaces are defined THEN both implementation and tests SHALL use the same interface
5. WHEN new methods are added to classes THEN corresponding tests SHALL be updated to match

### Requirement 4: Performance Test Stability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance tests to have realistic thresholds so that they don't fail due to environment variations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance tests check frame rates THEN thresholds SHALL be realistic for test environments
2. WHEN memory tests are executed THEN they SHALL account for environment-dependent memory usage
3. WHEN performance benchmarks are set THEN they SHALL be achievable in CI/CD environments
4. WHEN performance tests run multiple times THEN results SHALL be consistent within acceptable ranges
5. WHEN performance tests fail THEN error messages SHALL provide actionable debugging information

### Requirement 5: E2E Test Environment Separation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want E2E tests to run separately from unit tests so that different test types don't interfere with each other.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running unit tests THEN Playwright SHALL NOT be executed within Jest
2. WHEN running E2E tests THEN they SHALL use separate Playwright configuration
3. WHEN test environments are configured THEN Jest and Playwright SHALL have isolated settings
4. WHEN running `npm test` THEN only unit/integration tests SHALL execute
5. WHEN running `npm run test:e2e` THEN only E2E tests SHALL execute

### Requirement 6: Cross-Environment Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests to work in both browser and console environments so that testing is flexible and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests run in Node.js console environment THEN all mocks SHALL work properly
2. WHEN tests run in browser environment THEN all APIs SHALL be available
3. WHEN switching between environments THEN test results SHALL be consistent
4. WHEN environment-specific APIs are used THEN proper fallbacks SHALL be provided
5. WHEN tests access DOM APIs THEN jsdom SHALL provide complete compatibility

### Requirement 7: Test Suite Reliability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the test suite to achieve 95%+ success rate so that CI/CD pipelines are reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all fixes are implemented THEN test success rate SHALL be at least 95%
2. WHEN tests are run multiple times THEN results SHALL be consistent
3. WHEN CI/CD pipeline runs tests THEN they SHALL complete without infrastructure errors
4. WHEN test failures occur THEN they SHALL indicate actual code issues, not test configuration problems
5. WHEN new tests are added THEN they SHALL follow established patterns and not introduce instability

### Requirement 8: Development Workflow Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test fixes to integrate smoothly with existing development workflows so that productivity is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are fixed THEN existing npm scripts SHALL continue to work
2. WHEN test configuration is updated THEN it SHALL be backward compatible with existing test files
3. WHEN mock patterns are standardized THEN existing tests SHALL be updated incrementally
4. WHEN performance thresholds are adjusted THEN they SHALL still validate actual performance requirements
5. WHEN E2E tests are separated THEN the overall test execution time SHALL not significantly increase
