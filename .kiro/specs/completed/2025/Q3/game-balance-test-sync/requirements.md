# Requirements Document

## Introduction

ゲームバランス設定とテストの同期を行う機能です。現在、テストで期待される設定値と実際のGameBalance.jsの値に不整合があり、ゲームバランスとテストの信頼性に影響を与えています。この機能により、設定値の統一とバランス調整のガイドライン作成を行います。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all configuration values to be consistent between tests and implementation, so that test reliability and game balance predictability are maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a configuration value is defined in GameBalance.js THEN the same value SHALL be expected in corresponding unit tests
2. WHEN a test expects a specific configuration value THEN the implementation SHALL use the exact same value
3. WHEN configuration values are changed THEN both implementation and tests SHALL be updated simultaneously
4. IF there are discrepancies between test expectations and implementation THEN the system SHALL identify and report them

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a game designer, I want a unified configuration system that provides consistent values across all game components, so that balance adjustments are predictable and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing bubble configuration values THEN the system SHALL return consistent values regardless of access method
2. WHEN the new ConfigurationManager is used THEN it SHALL provide the same values as the legacy GameBalance.js
3. WHEN configuration values are accessed THEN they SHALL be validated against defined rules
4. IF invalid configuration values are detected THEN the system SHALL log warnings and use fallback values

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation of configuration changes and their impact, so that balance adjustments can be tracked and reverted if necessary.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration values are changed THEN the changes SHALL be documented with rationale
2. WHEN balance adjustments are made THEN their impact on gameplay SHALL be described
3. WHEN configuration discrepancies are resolved THEN the resolution process SHALL be documented
4. WHEN new configuration values are added THEN they SHALL include validation rules and default values

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want balance adjustment guidelines that ensure consistent and systematic approach to game tuning, so that changes are well-reasoned and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making balance changes THEN developers SHALL follow established guidelines
2. WHEN configuration values are modified THEN the impact on related systems SHALL be considered
3. WHEN new bubble types are added THEN their configuration SHALL follow established patterns
4. IF configuration changes affect multiple systems THEN all affected components SHALL be updated consistently

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want automated validation of configuration consistency, so that discrepancies are caught early in the development process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are run THEN configuration consistency SHALL be automatically validated
2. WHEN configuration files are modified THEN validation SHALL be triggered automatically
3. WHEN inconsistencies are detected THEN clear error messages SHALL be provided
4. IF configuration validation fails THEN the build process SHALL be halted until issues are resolved
