4. WHEN analyzing color contrast THEN the public API SHALL remain unchanged
5. WHEN color contrast is evaluated THEN WCAG AA/AAA contrast ratios SHALL be properly calculated

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AccessibilitySettingsUI.js file (2,697 words) to be split using Main Controller Pattern, so that accessibility settings UI is organized by functional components.

#### Acceptance Criteria
