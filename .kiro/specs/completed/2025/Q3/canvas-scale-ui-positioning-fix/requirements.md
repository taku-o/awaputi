# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses Issue #177 where UI elements in the BubblePop game are not properly considering canvas scaling, resulting in misaligned elements that appear in incorrect positions or are not visible on screen. The issue affects various parts of the application where canvas elements are displayed without proper scale consideration, leading to a poor user experience across different screen sizes and device pixel ratios.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want all UI elements to be properly positioned and scaled relative to the game canvas, so that I can see and interact with all game information regardless of my screen size or device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game loads on any screen size THEN all UI elements SHALL be positioned correctly relative to the scaled canvas
2. WHEN the screen is resized or orientation changes THEN all UI elements SHALL maintain their correct relative positions
3. WHEN the game runs on high-DPI displays THEN all UI elements SHALL be properly scaled and positioned
4. WHEN the ResponsiveCanvasManager calculates canvas scaling THEN all UI rendering SHALL use the calculated scale factors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game status information (score, HP, time) to be visible and properly positioned, so that I can monitor my game progress effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game is running THEN the score display SHALL be positioned relative to the scaled canvas coordinates
2. WHEN the game is running THEN the HP display and HP bar SHALL be positioned relative to the scaled canvas coordinates
3. WHEN the game is running THEN the time display SHALL be positioned relative to the scaled canvas coordinates
4. WHEN the canvas scale changes THEN all status elements SHALL automatically adjust their positions
5. WHEN status elements are animated THEN the animations SHALL respect the canvas scaling

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want game control buttons to be properly positioned and clickable, so that I can interact with the game controls effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN game control buttons are rendered THEN they SHALL be positioned using scaled coordinates
2. WHEN I click on game control buttons THEN the click detection SHALL account for canvas scaling
3. WHEN the canvas scale changes THEN button positions SHALL update automatically
4. WHEN buttons have hover states THEN the hover detection SHALL work correctly with scaled coordinates

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want all interactive elements (bubbles, UI components) to respond correctly to my input, so that the game feels responsive and accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click or tap on bubbles THEN the hit detection SHALL account for canvas scaling
2. WHEN I interact with any UI element THEN the coordinate conversion SHALL be accurate
3. WHEN using touch input on mobile devices THEN all interactions SHALL work correctly with scaling
4. WHEN the ResponsiveCanvasManager provides coordinate conversion methods THEN all input handling SHALL use these methods

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a consistent coordinate system throughout the application, so that all UI elements can be positioned reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rendering any UI element THEN the system SHALL provide scaled coordinate utilities
2. WHEN converting between screen and canvas coordinates THEN the system SHALL use ResponsiveCanvasManager methods
3. WHEN new UI elements are added THEN they SHALL automatically use the scaled coordinate system
4. WHEN debugging coordinate issues THEN the system SHALL provide logging and debugging tools
5. WHEN the canvas base size changes THEN all coordinate calculations SHALL remain accurate

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player using different devices, I want the game to look and work consistently across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices, so that I have a uniform gaming experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN playing on desktop THEN all UI elements SHALL be properly scaled and positioned
2. WHEN playing on tablet THEN all UI elements SHALL be properly scaled and positioned  
3. WHEN playing on mobile THEN all UI elements SHALL be properly scaled and positioned
4. WHEN switching between portrait and landscape orientations THEN UI elements SHALL reposition correctly
5. WHEN the device pixel ratio is different from 1.0 THEN all elements SHALL render at the correct scale
