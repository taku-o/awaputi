# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses GitHub issue #169, which is a sub-issue of #164 "ショートカットキーを整理する。不要なショートカットキーの削除。" (Organize keyboard shortcuts. Remove unnecessary keyboard shortcuts). The goal is to remove specific keyboard shortcuts that are deemed unnecessary for a casual game experience and update the related documentation accordingly.

The philosophy behind this change is that bubble pop games are typically casual games where users don't extensively use keyboard shortcuts. Instead, clear and obvious button-based operations should be provided. Some keyboard shortcuts should be replaced with UI elements in settings screens or main menus.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a casual game player, I want fewer keyboard shortcuts so that I don't accidentally trigger unwanted actions while playing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user presses the "I" key THEN the user info screen SHALL NOT open
2. WHEN the user presses the "S" key THEN the settings screen SHALL NOT open  
3. WHEN the user presses the "H" key THEN the help screen SHALL NOT open
4. WHEN the user attempts to use removed shortcuts THEN no unintended actions SHALL occur

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want the keyboard shortcut removal to be properly implemented so that the code is clean and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN keyboard shortcuts are removed THEN the corresponding handler methods SHALL be removed from KeyboardShortcutManager
2. WHEN keyboard shortcuts are removed THEN the shortcut registrations SHALL be removed from the initialization code
3. WHEN keyboard shortcuts are removed THEN no dead code SHALL remain in the codebase
4. WHEN the code is updated THEN all references to removed shortcuts SHALL be cleaned up

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user reading documentation, I want the keyboard shortcut documentation to be accurate so that I know which shortcuts are available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is updated THEN docs/keyboard-shortcuts.md SHALL reflect the removed shortcuts
2. WHEN documentation is updated THEN docs/keyboard-shortcuts.en.md SHALL reflect the removed shortcuts  
3. WHEN documentation is updated THEN the removed shortcuts SHALL NOT appear in any help text
4. WHEN documentation is updated THEN the remaining shortcuts SHALL be clearly documented

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure that removing these shortcuts doesn't break existing functionality so that the game remains stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN shortcuts are removed THEN existing game functionality SHALL continue to work normally
2. WHEN shortcuts are removed THEN other keyboard shortcuts SHALL continue to function properly
3. WHEN shortcuts are removed THEN the game SHALL start and run without errors
4. WHEN shortcuts are removed THEN no console errors SHALL be generated related to missing shortcuts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quality assurance tester, I want comprehensive tests to verify the shortcut removal so that I can confirm the changes work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are run THEN removed shortcuts SHALL be verified as non-functional
2. WHEN tests are run THEN remaining shortcuts SHALL be verified as functional
3. WHEN tests are run THEN the game SHALL load without keyboard shortcut related errors
4. WHEN tests are run THEN documentation accuracy SHALL be verified
