# Requirements Document

## Introduction

このプロジェクトでは、JavaScriptファイルにおいてクラス名とファイル名の重複が発生しており、これが開発時の混乱やメンテナンス性の低下を引き起こしています。分析の結果、31個の重複ファイル名と63個の重複クラス名が発見されました。これらの重複を解決し、将来的な重複を防ぐためのシステムを構築する必要があります。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all JavaScript class names to be unique across the codebase, so that I can easily identify and import the correct class without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the codebase THEN the system SHALL identify all duplicate class names
2. WHEN duplicate class names exist THEN the system SHALL rename them with appropriate prefixes or suffixes
3. WHEN renaming classes THEN the system SHALL maintain semantic meaning and follow naming conventions
4. WHEN classes are renamed THEN all import statements SHALL be updated accordingly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all JavaScript file names to be unique across the codebase, so that I can easily locate and reference files without ambiguity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the codebase THEN the system SHALL identify all duplicate file names
2. WHEN duplicate file names exist THEN the system SHALL rename them with appropriate prefixes or directory-based naming
3. WHEN renaming files THEN the system SHALL maintain logical organization and follow project conventions
4. WHEN files are renamed THEN all import paths SHALL be updated accordingly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a consistent naming strategy for resolving conflicts, so that the codebase maintains readability and follows established patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN resolving naming conflicts THEN the system SHALL apply consistent prefixing rules based on directory structure
2. WHEN multiple classes serve similar purposes THEN the system SHALL use domain-specific prefixes (e.g., Debug-, Audio-, Core-)
3. WHEN renaming affects exported classes THEN the system SHALL preserve backward compatibility where possible
4. WHEN applying naming conventions THEN the system SHALL follow the project's established patterns (PascalCase for classes, camelCase for files)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all import statements to be automatically updated when files or classes are renamed, so that the codebase remains functional after the refactoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file is renamed THEN all import statements referencing that file SHALL be updated
2. WHEN a class is renamed THEN all import statements importing that class SHALL be updated
3. WHEN updating imports THEN the system SHALL preserve the correct relative paths
4. WHEN imports are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain proper ES6 module syntax

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a validation system to prevent future naming conflicts, so that the codebase remains clean and organized over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new files are added THEN the system SHALL check for naming conflicts
2. WHEN conflicts are detected THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with suggested alternatives
3. WHEN running build processes THEN the system SHALL validate naming uniqueness
4. WHEN conflicts exist THEN the build process SHALL fail with descriptive error messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation of all changes made during the deduplication process, so that I can understand what was changed and why.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are renamed THEN the system SHALL log the old and new names
2. WHEN classes are renamed THEN the system SHALL document the changes with reasoning
3. WHEN imports are updated THEN the system SHALL track all modified files
4. WHEN the process completes THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive change report
