# Requirements Document

## Introduction

デバッグツール強化機能は、開発者の作業効率を向上させ、ゲームの品質向上とメンテナンス性を高めるための包括的な開発支援システムです。現在の基本的なデバッグ機能を大幅に拡張し、詳細なパフォーマンス監視、開発者コンソール、エラーレポート機能、テスト支援ツールを統合した開発環境を提供します。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive performance monitoring tools, so that I can identify and resolve performance bottlenecks efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the debug mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL display real-time FPS, memory usage, and frame time statistics
2. WHEN performance metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL maintain a historical record of at least 1000 data points
3. WHEN performance thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL automatically generate warnings and suggestions
4. WHEN rendering statistics are requested THEN the system SHALL provide detailed breakdown of render time, update time, and processing overhead
5. IF memory usage exceeds 80% of available heap THEN the system SHALL trigger automatic garbage collection recommendations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an interactive developer console, so that I can manipulate game state and settings in real-time during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the developer console is opened THEN the system SHALL provide command-line interface for game state manipulation
2. WHEN configuration values are modified through console THEN the system SHALL apply changes immediately without restart
3. WHEN test data generation is requested THEN the system SHALL create realistic mock data for various game scenarios
4. WHEN debug mode is toggled THEN the system SHALL switch between development and production behaviors seamlessly
5. IF invalid commands are entered THEN the system SHALL provide helpful error messages and command suggestions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated error reporting and collection, so that I can track and resolve issues systematically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL automatically collect detailed error information including stack traces
2. WHEN error patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL group similar errors and provide occurrence statistics
3. WHEN critical errors happen THEN the system SHALL immediately notify the developer with contextual information
4. WHEN error reports are generated THEN the system SHALL include environment details, user actions, and system state
5. IF error recovery is possible THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic recovery and log the recovery actions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want visual debugging tools for game state inspection, so that I can understand complex game behaviors at runtime.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN game state visualization is requested THEN the system SHALL display current values of all major game components
2. WHEN settings are modified in real-time THEN the system SHALL reflect changes immediately in the game
3. WHEN performance profiling is active THEN the system SHALL provide visual graphs and charts of performance metrics
4. WHEN memory leaks are suspected THEN the system SHALL provide memory usage analysis and leak detection tools
5. IF component interactions need inspection THEN the system SHALL provide dependency graphs and event flow visualization

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integrated testing support tools, so that I can run and validate tests efficiently during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN automated tests are triggered THEN the system SHALL execute all relevant test suites and display results
2. WHEN test data is needed THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate mock data for different test scenarios
3. WHEN test results are available THEN the system SHALL provide detailed reporting with pass/fail statistics
4. WHEN performance tests are run THEN the system SHALL benchmark key game functions and compare against baselines
5. IF test failures occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed failure analysis and debugging information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation and help system, so that I can effectively use all debugging tools and features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN help is requested THEN the system SHALL provide contextual documentation for current debugging tools
2. WHEN new debugging features are added THEN the system SHALL automatically update help documentation
3. WHEN command usage is unclear THEN the system SHALL provide examples and usage patterns
4. WHEN troubleshooting is needed THEN the system SHALL offer step-by-step debugging guides
5. IF advanced features are accessed THEN the system SHALL provide detailed technical documentation and best practices
