# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Issue #104で特定された5つの大容量バックアップファイルの調査と安全な削除を実施します。これらのファイルは大容量ファイル分割プロジェクト（Issue #77, #103）の過程で作成されたと推測され、リポジトリサイズの増大とメンテナンス負荷の原因となっています。対象ファイルは合計約14,000語（推定50-70KB）のサイズ削減効果が期待されます。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to investigate the 5 specific backup files identified in Issue #104, so that I can determine their safety for deletion and understand their relationship to current files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN investigating backup files THEN the system SHALL verify the existence of corresponding current files
2. WHEN checking file relationships THEN the system SHALL compare backup files with their current counterparts
3. WHEN analyzing Git history THEN the system SHALL determine when these backup files were created
4. WHEN checking references THEN the system SHALL search for any imports or mentions of these backup files
5. WHEN investigation is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a detailed analysis report

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to safely delete the identified backup files after thorough verification, so that the repository size is reduced without affecting functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deleting files THEN the system SHALL only delete files that have been verified as safe
2. WHEN performing deletion THEN the system SHALL delete files one by one with verification after each deletion
3. WHEN deletion is complete THEN the system SHALL verify that the file no longer exists
4. WHEN deletion fails THEN the system SHALL halt the process and report the error
5. WHEN all deletions are complete THEN the system SHALL run basic functionality tests

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation of the cleanup process, so that I can track what was removed and have recovery information if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting the process THEN the system SHALL record the initial state of all target files
2. WHEN performing investigations THEN the system SHALL log all findings and analysis results
3. WHEN deleting files THEN the system SHALL record deletion operations with timestamps
4. WHEN process is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a summary report with size reduction metrics
5. WHEN creating documentation THEN the system SHALL include recovery procedures using Git history

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that the deletion process doesn't break any functionality, so that the application continues to work correctly after cleanup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deletion is performed THEN the system SHALL run build verification after each file deletion
2. WHEN testing functionality THEN the system SHALL execute basic test suites
3. WHEN verifying integrity THEN the system SHALL check that all imports resolve correctly
4. IF any issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery instructions
5. WHEN verification is complete THEN the system SHALL confirm that all core functionality remains intact
