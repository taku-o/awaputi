# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for Phase F.3 of the large file splitting project, focusing on performance and utility files. The goal is to split 5-7 large files (over 2,500 words) into smaller, more manageable components while maintaining full functionality and improving maintainability. This phase specifically targets performance monitoring, diagnostics, configuration, and error handling utilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: File Size Compliance

**User Story:** As a developer using MCP tools, I want all performance and utility files to be under 2,500 words, so that I can work with them efficiently using AI-powered development tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all target files are processed THEN each resulting file SHALL be under 2,500 words
2. WHEN the splitting is complete THEN the PerformanceDataAnalyzer.js (2,871 words) SHALL be split into multiple focused components
3. WHEN the splitting is complete THEN the BalanceAdjustmentValidationRules.js (2,705 words) SHALL be split into logical validation modules
4. WHEN the splitting is complete THEN the PerformanceDiagnostics.js (2,644 words) SHALL be split into diagnostic components
5. WHEN the splitting is complete THEN the PerformanceConfigurationIntegration.js (2,531 words) SHALL be split into configuration modules
6. WHEN the splitting is complete THEN the ErrorHandler.js (2,520 words) SHALL be split into error handling components

### Requirement 2: Functional Integrity

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want all performance monitoring and error handling functionality to remain intact after file splitting, so that the game continues to operate correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are split THEN all existing public APIs SHALL remain unchanged
2. WHEN performance monitoring is active THEN all metrics collection SHALL continue to function identically
3. WHEN errors occur THEN error handling SHALL work exactly as before the split
4. WHEN performance diagnostics run THEN all diagnostic capabilities SHALL be preserved
5. WHEN configuration integration is used THEN all configuration features SHALL remain functional
6. WHEN balance adjustment validation runs THEN all validation rules SHALL continue to work

### Requirement 3: Architecture Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want the split files to follow consistent architectural patterns, so that the code remains easy to understand and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are split THEN each component SHALL follow the Main Controller Pattern
2. WHEN creating new modules THEN they SHALL use ES6 module syntax with .js extensions
3. WHEN splitting classes THEN the main class SHALL act as a controller coordinating sub-components
4. WHEN creating sub-components THEN they SHALL have clear, single responsibilities
5. WHEN organizing files THEN they SHALL be grouped in logical directory structures
6. WHEN implementing imports THEN all imports SHALL include .js extensions

### Requirement 4: Performance Monitoring System Split

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want the PerformanceDataAnalyzer to be split into focused components, so that I can work on specific aspects of performance monitoring independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PerformanceDataAnalyzer is split THEN it SHALL be divided into PerformanceMetricsCollector, PerformanceDataProcessor, PerformanceReportGenerator, and PerformanceThresholdManager
2. WHEN metrics collection runs THEN PerformanceMetricsCollector SHALL handle all data gathering
3. WHEN data processing occurs THEN PerformanceDataProcessor SHALL handle statistical analysis and trend calculation
4. WHEN reports are generated THEN PerformanceReportGenerator SHALL handle all report creation
5. WHEN thresholds are managed THEN PerformanceThresholdManager SHALL handle baseline and adaptive threshold management
6. WHEN the main analyzer runs THEN it SHALL coordinate all sub-components seamlessly

### Requirement 5: Error Handling System Split

**User Story:** As a developer debugging issues, I want the ErrorHandler to be split into specialized components, so that I can focus on specific aspects of error management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ErrorHandler is split THEN it SHALL be divided into ErrorLogger, ErrorReporter, ErrorRecovery, and ErrorAnalyzer components
2. WHEN errors are logged THEN ErrorLogger SHALL handle all logging functionality
3. WHEN errors need reporting THEN ErrorReporter SHALL handle user notifications and error display
4. WHEN recovery is attempted THEN ErrorRecovery SHALL handle all recovery strategies and fallback mechanisms
5. WHEN error analysis is needed THEN ErrorAnalyzer SHALL handle severity determination and error classification
6. WHEN the main handler runs THEN it SHALL coordinate all error handling sub-components

### Requirement 6: Test Coverage Maintenance

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want all existing tests to continue passing after file splitting, so that I can be confident the refactoring didn't break functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN file splitting is complete THEN all existing unit tests SHALL pass without modification
2. WHEN integration tests run THEN they SHALL pass with the new file structure
3. WHEN performance tests execute THEN they SHALL show no degradation in performance
4. WHEN test files are also split THEN PWATestFramework.js and StatisticsPerformance.test.js SHALL be split appropriately
5. WHEN new test files are created THEN they SHALL follow the same splitting principles
6. WHEN test imports are updated THEN they SHALL reference the correct new file locations

### Requirement 7: Documentation and Migration

**User Story:** As a developer joining the project, I want clear documentation of the new file structure, so that I can understand how the split components work together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are split THEN each new component SHALL have clear JSDoc documentation
2. WHEN the split is complete THEN import/export relationships SHALL be documented
3. WHEN new directory structures are created THEN they SHALL follow the established project conventions
4. WHEN the refactoring is done THEN a migration guide SHALL be created for developers
5. WHEN components interact THEN their relationships SHALL be clearly documented
6. WHEN the split is complete THEN the overall architecture SHALL be documented

### Requirement 8: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer using these utilities in other parts of the codebase, I want the public interfaces to remain unchanged, so that I don't need to update my existing code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN external code imports these utilities THEN the import statements SHALL continue to work
2. WHEN public methods are called THEN they SHALL behave identically to before the split
3. WHEN configuration is accessed THEN the same configuration options SHALL be available
4. WHEN events are emitted THEN they SHALL maintain the same event signatures
5. WHEN error handling is triggered THEN the same error handling behavior SHALL occur
6. WHEN performance monitoring is used THEN the same monitoring capabilities SHALL be available
