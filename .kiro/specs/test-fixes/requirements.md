# Requirements Document

## Introduction

現在136個のテストが失敗しており、主にJestのモック設定とテスト期待値の問題が原因です。品質保証とCI/CDパイプラインの安定化のため、これらのテスト問題を体系的に修正する必要があります。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all Jest mock configurations to be properly set up, so that unit tests can run without undefined errors

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are executed THEN jest.fn() SHALL be properly defined and available
2. WHEN mock functions are used THEN they SHALL have proper spy capabilities (toHaveBeenCalled, mockReturnValueOnce, etc.)
3. WHEN test setup is initialized THEN all required Jest globals SHALL be available
4. IF a test file uses Jest mocks THEN it SHALL properly import or configure Jest

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test expectations to match actual implementation values, so that tests accurately validate the system behavior

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration values are tested THEN expected values SHALL match actual default values in the implementation
2. WHEN performance metrics are tested THEN expected thresholds SHALL be realistic and achievable
3. WHEN integration tests run THEN they SHALL use consistent configuration values across all components
4. IF configuration defaults change THEN corresponding test expectations SHALL be updated

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration tests to properly handle dependencies, so that they can validate component interactions correctly

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration tests run THEN all required dependencies SHALL be properly initialized
2. WHEN components interact THEN the test environment SHALL simulate realistic conditions
3. WHEN configuration changes are tested THEN the propagation to dependent systems SHALL be verified
4. IF a component depends on another THEN the dependency SHALL be properly mocked or provided

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance tests to be stable and reliable, so that they can consistently validate system performance

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance tests run THEN they SHALL use realistic performance thresholds
2. WHEN measuring performance improvements THEN the baseline SHALL be properly established
3. WHEN cache effectiveness is tested THEN the measurement methodology SHALL be accurate
4. IF performance varies between runs THEN tests SHALL account for acceptable variance ranges

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all tests to pass consistently, so that the CI/CD pipeline can operate reliably

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all tests are executed THEN they SHALL pass without failures
2. WHEN tests are run multiple times THEN results SHALL be consistent
3. WHEN CI/CD pipeline runs THEN test execution SHALL not block deployment
4. IF a test fails THEN it SHALL provide clear diagnostic information
