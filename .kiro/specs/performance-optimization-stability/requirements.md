# Requirements Document

## Introduction

パフォーマンス最適化システムの改善と安定化を行います。現在のシステムは基本的な機能は実装されていますが、フレームレートの不安定性、メモリ使用量の最適化不足、品質設定とパフォーマンスの連携改善、パーティクルエフェクトの負荷軽減、レンダリング最適化の強化が必要です。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a game player, I want stable 60FPS performance, so that I can enjoy smooth gameplay without frame drops.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game is running THEN the system SHALL maintain 60FPS consistently
2. WHEN frame rate drops below 48FPS THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust quality settings
3. WHEN performance optimization is triggered THEN the system SHALL log the optimization actions taken
4. WHEN frame time variance exceeds 5ms THEN the system SHALL identify and address the instability source

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a game player, I want efficient memory usage, so that the game doesn't consume excessive system resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game is running THEN memory usage SHALL be reduced by 20% compared to current baseline
2. WHEN memory usage exceeds 80% of available heap THEN the system SHALL trigger garbage collection
3. WHEN memory leaks are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically clean up unused resources
4. WHEN object pools reach capacity THEN the system SHALL efficiently reuse existing objects

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a game player, I want an intelligent performance warning system, so that I'm informed about performance issues before they affect gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance metrics indicate potential issues THEN the system SHALL display appropriate warnings
2. WHEN FPS drops below threshold THEN the system SHALL show performance warning with suggested actions
3. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL warn users and suggest optimization
4. WHEN performance warnings are active THEN the system SHALL provide clear resolution steps

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a game player, I want automatic quality adjustment, so that performance is optimized without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance drops THEN the system SHALL automatically reduce quality settings
2. WHEN performance improves THEN the system SHALL gradually increase quality settings
3. WHEN quality adjustments are made THEN the system SHALL maintain visual consistency
4. WHEN automatic adjustment is disabled THEN the system SHALL respect manual quality settings

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a game player, I want stable performance tests, so that performance regressions can be detected and prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance tests are run THEN they SHALL complete without failures
2. WHEN performance regressions are detected THEN the system SHALL report specific metrics
3. WHEN performance tests run THEN they SHALL measure frame rate, memory usage, and rendering efficiency
4. WHEN test results are available THEN they SHALL be compared against baseline performance

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a mobile game player, I want optimized performance on mobile devices, so that the game runs smoothly on various hardware configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL detect device capabilities
2. WHEN device performance is limited THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate optimizations
3. WHEN touch interactions occur THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive performance
4. WHEN mobile-specific optimizations are applied THEN the system SHALL preserve core gameplay features

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want enhanced performance monitoring, so that I can identify and resolve performance bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance monitoring is active THEN the system SHALL collect detailed metrics
2. WHEN performance bottlenecks are detected THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information
3. WHEN monitoring data is requested THEN the system SHALL return comprehensive performance statistics
4. WHEN performance issues occur THEN the system SHALL log relevant context for debugging

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a game player, I want optimized particle effects, so that visual effects don't impact game performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN particle effects are active THEN they SHALL not cause frame rate drops below 50FPS
2. WHEN particle count exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL intelligently cull particles
3. WHEN particle quality is reduced THEN visual impact SHALL be minimized
4. WHEN particle effects are disabled THEN performance SHALL improve immediately

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a game player, I want improved rendering optimization, so that graphics are rendered efficiently without visual artifacts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rendering optimization is active THEN unnecessary redraws SHALL be eliminated
2. WHEN dirty regions are detected THEN only affected areas SHALL be redrawn
3. WHEN layer management is optimized THEN rendering performance SHALL improve by at least 15%
4. WHEN viewport culling is applied THEN off-screen objects SHALL not be rendered

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a game player, I want reliable memory management, so that the game doesn't crash due to memory issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN memory management is active THEN memory leaks SHALL be prevented
2. WHEN garbage collection is triggered THEN it SHALL not cause noticeable frame drops
3. WHEN memory cleanup occurs THEN essential game state SHALL be preserved
4. WHEN memory pressure is high THEN the system SHALL prioritize critical resources
