# Requirements Document

## Introduction

GitHub issue #85のsub issueとして、大容量ファイル分割プロジェクト Phase E.4の実装を行います。バックアップファイルの状況確認と、残存する大容量ツールファイルの分割・最適化により、プロジェクトの整理とMCPツール互換性の向上を図ります。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify the current status of backup files and complete their cleanup process, so that the project structure is clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backup file cleanup status is checked THEN the system SHALL confirm that all backup files (*_old.js, *_original.js) have been properly removed
2. WHEN backup file metadata is reviewed THEN the system SHALL verify that backup copies exist in .cleanup-backups directory
3. IF any backup files still exist THEN the system SHALL safely remove them following established cleanup procedures
4. WHEN backup cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL update project documentation to reflect the cleanup status

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to split large tool files into smaller components, so that they are compatible with MCP tools and easier to maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN large tool files are identified THEN the system SHALL split files exceeding 2,500 words into smaller components
2. WHEN api-doc-generator.js is split THEN the system SHALL create separate modules for parsing, generation, templating, and validation
3. WHEN tool files are split THEN each resulting file SHALL be under 2,500 words for MCP tool compatibility
4. WHEN tool splitting is complete THEN all original functionality SHALL be preserved through proper module integration

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to optimize large test files, so that they are more manageable and maintain good test organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN large test files are identified THEN the system SHALL split ComparisonEngine.test.js into focused test modules
2. WHEN test files are split THEN the system SHALL organize tests by functionality (basic, advanced, performance, integration)
3. WHEN test splitting is complete THEN all test cases SHALL continue to execute successfully
4. WHEN test optimization is done THEN test execution time and maintainability SHALL be improved

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure project structure optimization, so that the codebase is clean and well-organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN file splitting is complete THEN all resulting files SHALL be under 2,500 words
2. WHEN project structure is optimized THEN unnecessary directories and files SHALL be removed
3. WHEN optimization is complete THEN the system SHALL verify MCP tool compatibility with find_symbol operations
4. WHEN project cleanup is finished THEN documentation SHALL be updated to reflect the new structure

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain system stability during optimization, so that existing functionality is not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any file is modified or split THEN the system SHALL run comprehensive tests to verify functionality
2. WHEN tool files are split THEN the system SHALL verify that all tools continue to work as expected
3. WHEN changes are made THEN the system SHALL ensure backward compatibility is maintained
4. WHEN optimization is complete THEN the system SHALL perform a full system integration test
