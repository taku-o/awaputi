# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses GitHub issue #172, which is a sub-issue of #164 focused on keyboard shortcut reorganization. The goal is to replace keyboard-only game control functions (Give Up and Restart) with visible UI buttons in the game interface, making the game more accessible and user-friendly by providing clear visual controls instead of relying on keyboard shortcuts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Give Up Button Implementation

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see a "Give Up" button during gameplay, so that I can easily end the current game without needing to remember keyboard shortcuts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game is in active gameplay state THEN the system SHALL display a "Give Up" (ギブアップ) button in the game UI
2. WHEN the player clicks the "Give Up" button THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation dialog asking "ゲームを終了しますか？"
3. WHEN the player confirms the give up action THEN the system SHALL end the current game and return to the main menu
4. WHEN the player cancels the give up action THEN the system SHALL close the confirmation dialog and continue the game
5. WHEN the game is paused or in game over state THEN the "Give Up" button SHALL remain visible and functional
6. WHEN the game is not in GameScene THEN the "Give Up" button SHALL NOT be displayed

### Requirement 2: Restart Button Implementation

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see a "Restart" button during gameplay, so that I can easily restart the current game without needing to remember keyboard shortcuts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game is in active gameplay state THEN the system SHALL display a "Restart" (ゲーム再開始) button in the game UI
2. WHEN the player clicks the "Restart" button THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation dialog asking "ゲームを再開始しますか？"
3. WHEN the player confirms the restart action THEN the system SHALL reset the current game state and start a new game
4. WHEN the player cancels the restart action THEN the system SHALL close the confirmation dialog and continue the game
5. WHEN the game is paused or in game over state THEN the "Restart" button SHALL remain visible and functional
6. WHEN the game is not in GameScene THEN the "Restart" button SHALL NOT be displayed

### Requirement 3: Keyboard Shortcut Removal

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want the G and R keyboard shortcuts removed, so that the game relies on clear UI buttons instead of hidden keyboard shortcuts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes keyboard shortcuts THEN the system SHALL NOT register the 'G' key for give up functionality
2. WHEN the system initializes keyboard shortcuts THEN the system SHALL NOT register the 'R' key for restart functionality
3. WHEN the player presses the 'G' key during gameplay THEN the system SHALL NOT trigger any give up functionality
4. WHEN the player presses the 'R' key during gameplay THEN the system SHALL NOT trigger any restart functionality
5. WHEN the keyboard shortcut documentation is accessed THEN the system SHALL NOT list G or R keys as available shortcuts

### Requirement 4: UI Design and Layout

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game control buttons to be clearly visible and easily accessible, so that I can use them without interfering with gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game UI is rendered THEN the control buttons SHALL be positioned in a non-intrusive location that doesn't overlap with gameplay area
2. WHEN the game UI is rendered THEN the buttons SHALL have clear, readable Japanese text ("ギブアップ" and "ゲーム再開始")
3. WHEN the game UI is rendered THEN the buttons SHALL have appropriate styling that matches the game's visual design
4. WHEN the game UI is rendered THEN the buttons SHALL be large enough for easy clicking/tapping on both desktop and mobile devices
5. WHEN the game is in different states (playing, paused, game over) THEN the buttons SHALL remain consistently positioned and styled

### Requirement 5: Documentation Updates

**User Story:** As a user reading the game documentation, I want accurate information about available controls, so that I understand how to interact with the game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the keyboard shortcuts documentation is updated THEN it SHALL remove references to G and R key shortcuts
2. WHEN the keyboard shortcuts documentation is updated THEN it SHALL mention that game control functions are available through UI buttons
3. WHEN the documentation is updated THEN both Japanese and English versions SHALL reflect the changes consistently
4. WHEN the help system is accessed in-game THEN it SHALL show current control methods without mentioning removed shortcuts

### Requirement 6: Accessibility and Responsiveness

**User Story:** As a player using different devices or accessibility tools, I want the control buttons to work properly across all supported platforms and input methods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game is played on mobile devices THEN the buttons SHALL be touch-friendly with appropriate tap targets
2. WHEN the game is played on desktop THEN the buttons SHALL respond to mouse clicks and hover states
3. WHEN accessibility features are enabled THEN the buttons SHALL be properly labeled for screen readers
4. WHEN the game window is resized THEN the buttons SHALL maintain their relative positioning and remain functional
5. WHEN keyboard navigation is used THEN the buttons SHALL be focusable and activatable with Enter key
